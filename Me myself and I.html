	<p> Hello there! I'm Vuong Binh Minh, a Graphic Designer/Artist with a big passion for 2D Animation. I'm always trying to be happy and positive all the time. Laughter is a great medicine to get me through not so good times. I'm also a foodie and love creating bizarre food combinations, like spaghetti sandwiches which taste amazing! 
	Right now life is super tough with Covid and lockdowns. But I consider it a big challenge in life to conquer and I believe if we stay strong we can do anything! </p>
